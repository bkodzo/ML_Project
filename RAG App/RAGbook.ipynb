      "of the Internet of Things. It is diﬃcult to deal with these threats and \n",
      "ensure network security because common  approaches, such as intru-\n",

      "threats. Thus, FANET  requires a defensive system to prevent damage \n",
      "to drones because they are an attractive goal for cyberattacks, such \n",
      "as wormholes. The detection of this attack is very challenging because \n",
      "wormholes can be implemented in FANET  without accessing secret keys, \n",
      "capturing UAVs,  or knowing the routing protocol [16–18]. As a result, \n",
      "most powerful key cryptography methods cannot neutralize this attack \n",
      "and protect communication. A wormhole does not require the content \n",
      "of control packets. It is very diﬃcult to detect wormholes because they \n",
      "make no change to the contents of the packets [19–21].\n",
      "In a wormhole attack, a malicious UAV  constantly checks wireless \n",
      "communication channels and captures the exchanged packets [22,23]. \n",
      "Then, these packets will be tunneled into another malicious UAV.  Lastly, \n",
      "it disseminates these packets locally in its surrounding area [24,25]. \n",
      "Hence, UAVs  close to these attackers cannot ﬁnd legal routes in the net-\n",
      "work because wormholes announce attractive paths with one or two \n",
      "hops, while legal paths have more hops. After performing this subver-\n",

      "attack can negatively aﬀect a wide range of routing protocols because \n",
      "it can provide suitable conditions for implementing other attacks such \n",
      "as selective forwarding (SF), traﬃc analysis, or denial of service (DoS) \n",
      "attacks [28,29]. In general, malicious nodes launch wormholes in two \n",
      "modes, namely hidden and participation. In the hidden mode, malicious \n",
      "UAVs  hide their identiﬁers in FANETs [30,31]. In this case, they play \n",
      "the role of simple transceivers. These hostile UAVs  sniﬀ data packets on \n",
      "one side of the wormhole tunnel. Then, they capture and propagate these \n",
      "packets on the other side of this tunnel [32,33]. Clearly, this wormhole \n",
      "attack does not require any secret key. In the hidden mode, there are two \n",
      "types of wormholes, namely encapsulation and packet relay [34,35]. In \n",
      "packet encapsulation, the ﬁrst attacker performs the encapsulation op-\n",
      "eration as soon as it captures a packet. This prevents the increase in hop \n",
      "counts in the original packet. Then, the encapsulated packet is sent to \n",
      "the second attacker through the wormhole tunnel [36–38]. In the packet \n",
      "relay, the network can be threatened by only one malicious UAV.  This \n",
      "attacker rebroadcasts packets received from a legal UAV  to other dis-\n",
      "tant UAVs. As a result, these distant UAVs  mistakenly imagine that they \n",
      "are neighbors. In the participation mode, attackers need secret keys in \n",
      "the network to run powerful attacks on FANET  [39–41]. These attack-\n",
      "ers act as legal UAVs  and play the role of intermediate nodes in routing \n",
      "paths. Wormholes increase the attractiveness of their illegal routes in \n",
      "terms of low delay and least hops [42,43]. In the participation mode, \n",
      "there are two types of wormholes, namely, high transmission power and \n",
      "out-of-band channel. In the wormhole with high transmission power, \n",
      "the attacker has a high transmission power [44,45]. This feature in-\n",

      "bandwidth to build an attractive path in FANET  [46,47].\n",
      "Due to the limited resources, especially bandwidth and energy, in \n",
